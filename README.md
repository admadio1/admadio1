Hi, I'm Adam, I am currently attending J Sergeant Reynolds Community College in Richmond, VA for Network Fundamentals
and am learning to code in my free time. Right now I am working my way through the front end web dev curriculum on
freeCodeCamp.com and am just here to look around and post any code that I may write. I'm looking forward to getting involved!
